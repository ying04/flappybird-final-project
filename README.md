Flappy Bird LED Simulation

Overview
Flappy Bird LED Simulation is an interactive hardware project built for FPGA or microcontroller platforms. The game replicates the classic Flappy Bird gameplay using an 8x8 LED matrix to display the bird and obstacles, 7-segment displays for scoring, and a buzzer for audio feedback.


Key Features:
-8x8 LED Matrix: Displays the bird and the pipes dynamically.
-7-Segment Display: Shows the player's current score.
-Buzzer Support: Provides audio feedback for collisions or actions.
-User Interaction: Controlled via button inputs for gameplay.


How to Play:

-Controlling the Bird:
Use the player1 button to make the bird jump. If you donâ€™t press it, the bird will gradually fall.

-Avoiding Obstacles:
The bird must pass through the gaps between the moving pipes. If the bird hits a pipe or falls off the screen, the game ends.

-Timer:
There will be a timer that tells you how much time hass pass. If the time reach 60s you win


Objective:
Achieve the highest score possible by navigating the bird through the gaps in the pipes.


Game Over Conditions:
The game ends if the bird collides with a pipe or falls below the screen.


Restarting:
Press the restart button to play again after the game ends.


Modes:
Use the mode button to change difficulty levels or adjust settings before starting the game.
